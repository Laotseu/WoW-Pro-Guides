== What is this? ==
This is a fork of [https://github.com/Jiyambi/WoW-Pro-Guides Jiyambi/WoW-Pro-Guides]. I like the WoWPro guides 
but I also like to hack stuff to have work just to like I want to. I'm posting my fork here in case someone want to see/use
my hacks.

== What hacks? ==
Here's a sumery of the main changes I made to [https://github.com/Jiyambi/WoW-Pro-Guides Jiyambi/WoW-Pro-Guides].
* Reworked the mapping code to use TomTom more directly and deal with the way points a bit differently
* Change the leaderboard code to always use the quest objective text (I had some issues with the objectives not being reflected properly)
* Removed the radio button in the menus
* Actived the tooltips on the quest items button
* Generate two macros for the current item and target buttons so I can put them on the actoin bars
* Made the current item and target buttons the lowers one instead of the top one from the step list (use the current over the stickies)
* Maintain the completeQID list up to date with every turn-ins and use it to update must of the guide steps instead of reliying on event
* In general, always try to check with was is instead of what happened for updating the guide steps
* Used [http://www.wowace.com/addons/findglobals/ FindGlobals] and recast all global variables to local ones for speed and sanity
* Multiple tweaks to the guides to make them work more like I want them to

== Thanks ==
