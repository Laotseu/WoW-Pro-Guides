N How to use this Guide|QID|99999|N|This guide includes many 5-Man Quests. It is unlikely that you will find a random group for those since the release of Cataclysm, but you can easily solo most of them once your character wears Cataclysm-Gear. If you already have a full equipment from any of the Cataclysm zones, you can try to do them solo, if you don't, just skip those Quests.|
N The Skybreaker |N|The main quest hob for Icecrown is a ship flying around named The Skybreaker. Since the ship is moving all the time, the coordinate given are only an indication of the general location where it patrols. Officer Van Rossem in Dalaran is always willing to send you to the ship if you ask him.|
