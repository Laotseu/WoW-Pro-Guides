- Bug: with sticky steps that get checked completed even if the quest is not complete or the step was not done
- Bug: mapping when there is a change of continent doesn't work the first time
- Disable the check boxes for quest that are completed since they can't be uncompleted
- Bring most of the Module_Parser code into the core addon because it's mostly the same thing for all the guides
